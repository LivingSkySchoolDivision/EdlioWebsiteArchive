					<description><![CDATA[We will have a staggered start to the school year. The first week students will come every second day decided by their last name: 

 

Sept. 8th last names A-M

September 9th last names N-Z 

September 10th last names A-M again

September 11th last names N-Z again

For the first week of school (September 8-11th), all students and families will meet outside of the school in designated areas of the school yard. Parents will be able to find their childâ€™s grade and teacher by finding the grade labeled sign that will be staked in various spots in our schoolyard. Teachers will be at their grade labeled sign to greet and welcome families.

Pre-K students will start school the week of September 14-18th. We will be in touch with Pre-K families regarding specific details.

We are excited to begin the 2020-21 school year!!]]></description>
