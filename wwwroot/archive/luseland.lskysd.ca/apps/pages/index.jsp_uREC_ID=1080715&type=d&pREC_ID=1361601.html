<p><strong>ATTENDANCE</strong></p>
<p>Good attendance at school is essential for students to master the outcomes in each of their courses. If a student is going to be absent from school, parents/guardians should inform the school office of the reason for the absence, even if they have let the homeroom teacher know. Parents/guardians should contact the school office by email or phone as soon as they can, but before 8:45am on the day of the absence if possible (306-372-4222 or <a href="mailto:luseland@lskysd.ca">luseland@lskysd.ca</a> In addition, if the absence is planned, parents/guardians are asked to notify the school office in advance.</p>
<p>If a student is absent from school and his/her parents/guardians have not contacted the school, an email informing them of the student absence will be sent to the parent/guardian email address that was provided on the student registration form. For K-6 students, the email will be sent after the morning and afternoon attendance is taken. For 7-12 students, the email will be sent for each absent period.</p>
<p>If the staff believes attendance is impacting student learning, parents/guardians will be contacted. If attendance continues to be an issue, a meeting will be scheduled for the student, parents/guardians, and applicable staff members to create an improvement plan for student success.</p>
<p>Parents/guardians can access student attendance records on Home Logic. Parents/guardians are encouraged to call the school if support is needed to access information on Home Logic.</p>
<p>When a student in 7-12 is late or absent, it is the student's responsibility to check with their teacher or a classmate for information about what was missed in class. Absent students have the responsibility to make up any required work in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>SKIPPING CLASS</strong></p>
<p>Students are under the responsibility of the school staff during school hours and it is crucial that staff members know where their students are at all times. For this reason, skipping class will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Skipping class means leaving the school without prior parental/guardian/staff permission. Any students who skips class will be expected to make up any work and/or time missed, under the supervision of their teacher and school administration, as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>SIGNING IN / SIGNING OUT</strong></p>
<p>All students in Grade 7-12 arriving or leaving during school hours must sign in or out at the office.&nbsp; Students are not allowed to sign out without permission from their parent/guardian or their teacher.</p>
<p><strong>STAYING IN AT RECESS</strong></p>
<p>If a child in grade K-6 is required to stay inside at recess, a note, text, email, or phone call from the parent/guardian with the reason is needed. Please note that if a student is too sick to go outside, then they are likely too sick to come to school.</p>
<p><strong>OPEN CAMPUS</strong></p>
<p>Grade 11 and 12 students have the option of utilizing an open campus. After an open campus form is completed, students may leave the school property during their spares, as long as they sign out at the office upon leaving and sign in at the office upon returning.</p>
<p><strong>PBIS STUDENT BEHAVIOUR MATRIX</strong></p>
<p>All students are expected to demonstrate appropriate behavior on the bus, in the various locations in the school, in the schoolyard, and when on school trips and excursions.&nbsp; The Student Behavior Matrix provides examples of appropriate behavior under the following three guiding principles: Be Responsible, Be Respectful, Be Safe.&nbsp; The Student Behavior Matrix will be posted in various locations in the school and on each route bus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that students who practice the appropriate behaviors found in the Student Behavior Matrix will contribute to a positive school climate, which is crucial for student success.&nbsp; The staff works each year to have students learn, practice, and relearn these expected behaviors when needed. The Discipline Cycle applies to students who exhibit major problem behavior or recurring minor problem behavior rather than appropriate behavior.</p>
<p><strong>BULLYING POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Luseland School does not tolerate bullying in any form. All members of the staff and SCC are committed to ensuring a safe and caring environment, which promotes personal growth and positive self-esteem for all. &nbsp;Since student bullies often target other students when adults are not around, the school staff may not be aware of bullying;&nbsp;Therefore, it is essential that parents/guardians and students report bullying to the homeroom teacher or another staff member as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is bullying?</strong></p>
<p>Conflict can occur when a group of people spend a lot of time together, like students do at school.&nbsp; One of the skills we want students to learn is how to resolve conflict.&nbsp; Not all conflict between students involves bullying.&nbsp; Bullying is a conscious, willful, and deliberate hostile activity intended to harm, induce fear through threat of further aggression, and create terror. Bullying is an act of aggression causing embarrassment, pain, or discomfort to another: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>it can take a number of forms: physical, verbal, relational, gestures, extortion, and exclusion</li>
<li>it is an abuse of power</li>
<li>it can be planned and organized</li>
<li>individuals or groups may be involved</li>
</ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traits of Bullies</strong></p>
<p>Although the ways and means of bullying may be different, bullies often have these traits in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>they dominate over other people</li>
<li>they use other people to get what they want</li>
<li>they find it hard to see a situation from the other person's vantage point</li>
<li>they are concerned with their own wants and pleasures and not the needs, rights, and feelings of others</li>
<li>they tend to hurt other children when parents/guardians or other adults are not around</li>
<li>they view weaker siblings or peers as prey</li>
<li>they use blame, criticism, and false allegations to project their own inadequacies onto their target</li>
<li>they refuse to accept responsibility for their actions</li>
<li>they can lack foresight; therefore, the ability to consider the short-term, long-term, and possible unintended consequences of their current behavior</li>
<li>they crave attention</li>
</ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of Bullying:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>any form of physical violence such as hitting, pushing, or spitting on others</li>
<li>interfering with another's property by stealing, hiding, damaging or destroying it</li>
<li>using offensive names, taunting or spreading rumors about others or their families</li>
<li>using put-downs, belittling others' abilities and achievements</li>
<li>writing offensive notes or graffiti about others</li>
<li>making degrading comments about another's culture, religious or social background</li>
<li>hurtfully excluding others from a group</li>
<li>shunning or ignoring the person on purpose (with exception to ignoring a person for bad behavior)</li>
<li>making suggestive comments or other forms of sexual abuse</li>
<li>ridiculing another's appearance over and over again</li>
<li>forcing others to act against their will.</li>
<li>Cyber bullying</li>
</ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are bullied:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>we may feel frightened, unsafe, embarrassed, angry or unfairly treated</li>
<li>our work, sleep and ability to concentrate may suffer</li>
<li>our relationships with our family and friends may deteriorate, we may feel confused and not know what to do about the problem</li>

<p><strong>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do to prevent bullying at Luseland School?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>All members of our school community (staff, students, parents/guardians) will not allow cases of bullying to go unreported but will speak up, even at risk to ourselves.</p>
<ul>
<ol>
<li>This requires staff to:</li>
<ol>
<li>be role models in word and actions at all times</li>
<li>be observant of signs of distress or suspected incidents of bullying</li>
<li>make efforts to remove occasions for bullying by being aware of duties during supervision and arrive at class on time</li>
<li>take steps to help victims and remove sources of distress without placing the victim at further risk</li>
<li>report suspected incidents to the appropriate staff members and to the administrators&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li>This requires the students to:</li>
<ol>
<li>refuse to participate in any bullying situation. If you are present when bullying occurs, then take an appropriate form of preventative action quickly. Some examples of what to do would be:</li>
<ol>
<li>If the bullying is physical, then say to the bully in a firm authoritative voice to move away from the victim. If the behavior has attracted an audience, tell the onlookers to return to their room or go somewhere else.</li>
<li>If the bullying is verbal, tell the bully to stop immediately, and that we don't use those words with others at our school.</li>
<li>If the bullying is emotional, tell the bully to stop the uncalled for action and that everyone in our school is welcomed and accepted.</li>
</ol>
<li>immediately report the incident or suspected incident and help break down the code of secrecy</li>
<li>if a student is a witness to bullying, the bully should be reported to help prevent further incidents from occurring. Any information shared will be kept in as much confidence as possible.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ul>
<ul>
<ol>
<li>Parents/guardians should:</li>
<ol>
<li>watch for signs of distress in their child, e.g. unwillingness to attend school, a pattern of headaches, missing school supplies, requests for extra money, damaged clothes or bruising</li>
<li>take an active interest in your child's social life and acquaintances</li>
<li>advise your child to tell a staff member about the incident. If possible allow the child to report and deal with the problem him/herself</li>
<li>inform school staff (homeroom teacher, or administrator) if bullying is suspected</li>
<li>keep a written record (who, what, when, where, why, how)</li>
<li>do&nbsp;not&nbsp;encourage the child to retaliate; instead, teach them to be assertive and stand up for themselves, rather than aggressive</li>
<li>communicate to your child that parental involvement, if necessary, will be appropriate for the situation</li>
<li>be willing to attend meetings at the school if your child is involved in any bullying incident</li>
<li>be willing to inform the school of any cases of suspected bullying even if your own child is not directly affected</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ul>
<p>When staff, students, and parents/guardians work together, we can create and achieve a positive environment for all.</p>
<p><strong>PLAYGROUND RULES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have fun! Play safe!</li>
<li>Play within the defined playground areas. Include others.</li>
<li>Respect each other's personal space.</li>
<li>Electronic devices should be kept in your backpack in the school (students will not be allowed to use them at recess times)</li>
<li>Keep our playground neat (Do not take snack wrappers, bags etc. outside at recess)</li>
<li>Use playground activities from the equipment shed respectfully and put away neatly when bell rings (last person to touch when bell rings puts away in shed)</li>
<li>Use large playground equipment as it was intended to be used.&nbsp; Use the slide&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;person at a time.</li>
<li>When playing on any ice surface helmets must be worn.</li>
<li>When using sticks such as hockey, broomball or lacrosse, helmets&nbsp;with a cage&nbsp;must be worn (On or off the ice).</li>
<li>When playing softball, catchers must wear protective equipment including helmet, mask, and chest protector.</li>
<li>Dress appropriately for the weather. Even in very cold weather, students will go outside for a few minutes so make sure to always have appropriate clothes available. Teachers make a call as to how long to keep students outside, but we always go out for a couple of minutes of fresh air and exercise.</li>
<li>If you are too sick or injured to go out at recess bring a signed note from a parent or guardian and then you can stay in.</li>
<li>For safety reasons, tag or any sort of running game&nbsp;on the equipment&nbsp;is not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DISCIPLINE CYCLE</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the discipline cycle is to provide consistent logical consequences and further support to adopt acceptable behavior for students who continue to exhibit problem behavior.</p>
<p>Step 1- All inappropriate minor behavior incidents are handled by staff by on the spot in class, halls, lunchrooms, and other general areas of the school. &nbsp;Depending on the situation, initially staff may engage the student in a conversation for success and reteach the acceptable behavior expectation and have students practice the acceptable behavior.&nbsp; If the same type of minor problem behavior with the student persists, the staff member may administer a consequence and have the conversation for success, reteach, and have the student practice.&nbsp; In addition, the student will complete the reflection and action plan on the back of the referral form, and the staff member will fill out the details of the minor problem behavior on the front of the referral form.&nbsp; The student may be asked to call home to describe their problem behavior to a parent/guardian.&nbsp; If the problem behavior occurs a third time, the behavior will be considered a major problem behavior.</p>
<p>Step 2&nbsp;- For the first major office referral during a school year, a student will be sent to the office and will spend up to one class period completing their reflection and short action plan on the back side of the SWIS form. The student should not leave until given permission by the staff member, who will also complete his/her portion of the SWIS Office Referral Form.&nbsp; A school administrator will complete the admin portion of the referral form and will inform the parent/guardian about the student's problem behavior, the consequences applied, and what will happen if this major problem behavior occurs again.</p>
<p>Step 3&nbsp;- For the 2nd major office referral, a student repeats the above and an In School Suspension (I.S.S.) contract is drawn up and will take effect on the 3rd major office referral. &nbsp;A school administrator will inform the parent/guardian about this situation.</p>
<p>Step 4&nbsp;- For the 3rd major office referral, or any major office referral deemed serious enough to warrant a full day suspension immediately, the student spends the equivalent of up to a full day in an In School Suspension, and the I.S.S contract is enforced. Any student receiving an I.S.S will be ineligible for any and all extra-curricular activities for that day and a loss of privelage consequence will also be in effect. For any further major problem behavior incidents, the I.S.S. contract may be applied as is or adjusted by a school administrator and then applied.&nbsp; A school administrator will inform the parent/guardian of all major problem behaviors leading to an I.S.S.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5&nbsp;- Out of school suspension (O.S.S.) of up to 10 days is used only after the use of I.S.S. has proven ineffective for a student or if the major problem behavior is an offense that is viewed as serious enough to warrant summary suspension. Any student receiving an O.S.S. will be ineligible for any and all extra-curricular activities for a period of time as determined by school administration.</p>
<p>Step 6&nbsp;- Expulsion, placement out of regular school setting, or into a residential treatment program, are used as the last resort when all else has been tried and the student is continues to exhibit serious major problem behavior.</p>
<p><strong>IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION (I.S.S.)</strong></p>
<p>The goals of the I.S.S. are to teach students to accept logical consequences for their actions, give them time to reflect on their behavior and so they become actively involved in finding and setting goals to learn positive alternatives to problem behavior.</p>
<p>An I.S.S. contract is a plan drawn up for students who require further support to replace problem behavior with appropriate behavior.&nbsp; The I.S.S. contract is drawn up and signed by student, parent/guardian, and administrator after the 2nd&nbsp;incident of problem behavior and takes effect following a 3rd incidence of problem behavior.</p>
<p><strong>EXPECTATIONS FOR AN IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The student must come directly to the office upon reaching school and you will be directed by a teacher to get books.</li>
<li>The student may leave the room only when accompanied by a staff member.</li>
<li>Junk food, cell phones &amp; media players, games of any kind, etc. are to be left at the office.</li>
<li>The student may not take part in any extra-curricular school activities for that day and a number of days following&nbsp;(as determined by administration).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>RESTITUTION</strong></p>
<p>Restitution is a school process that will be utilized in conjunction with the discipline policy. It stems from the 5 basic needs of Belonging, Safety, Freedom, Power (Competence), and Fun. Whenever one of these needs is not being met, conflict can arise. The staff and students have discussed 5 guiding principles in student behavior matrix that govern student actions in the school. &nbsp;If these principles are not being followed by a student, he/she may do restitution to try to fix their mistake or make it right.</p>
<p><strong>LUSELAND SCHOOL CELL PHONE POLICY</strong></p>
<p>The use of cell phones for any purpose that does not violate the Technology Policy will be permitted from the time students arrive at school in the morning until start of class, during breaks, at noon from 12:00 until 12:45 and after school (3:15 on regular days, 2:45 on early dismissals for Staff Meetings, and 1:45 on early dismissals for PLC's).</p>
<p>During instructional time, students are allowed to use cell phones only with permission from the staff member supervising them.&nbsp; The staff member may collect some or all students' cell phones for the class period. Staff will only access cell phones to turn them off if necessary.&nbsp; Cell phone use is covered by the Luseland School Technology Policy.</p>
<p><em>Consequences</em></p>
<p>Using a cell phone in a manner that violates the Cell Phone or Technology policies will be handled using the Discipline Cycle. As part of a consequence for misuse of a cell phone, staff may take student cell phones away with the cell phone being returned to the student at the end of the school day. Multiple violations of policy may result in other consequences.</p>
<p>LUSELAND SCHOOL USE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY</p>
<p><em>Rationale</em></p>
<p>The responsible use of technology is the focus of this policy. The purpose of the policy is not to ban the use of technology, but help guide students to use technology responsibly in the classroom and become responsible digital citizens.</p>

<ol>
<li>This policy will apply to all technology used at school at any time of the day, including before and after regular school hours. This includes, but is not limited to: computers, laptops, netbooks, tablets, e-readers, the internet, cameras, cell phones, iPods, and MP3 and other music players. &nbsp;This policy also applies to school devices at any time and location.</li>
<li>In this policy technology will refer to, but not limited to, the devices listed in (1).</li>
<li>Students can access the public wireless using their division username and password.</li>
<li>The responsible use of technology means that students will:</li>

</ol>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Consequences</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>If students cannot use technology responsibly they may not be allowed to use technology at school: Students using technology irresponsibly, as set out by the above policy will face the following consequences:</p>
<p><em>First Offence:</em></p>
<p>The student will complete a minor/major SWIS form and be placed on the discipline cycle as deemed appropriate by the referring staff member. &nbsp;If the technology used to violate the policy is a student's personal device, it will be confiscated and may be taken to the office. When taken to the office, the device can be picked up at the end of the school day.</p>
<p><em>Further Offences:</em></p>
<p>The same consequences as above; as well, students may lose privileges to bring and/or use technology at school. This will be determined on a case by case basis.</p>
<p><strong>DRESS CODE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothing</p>
<p>Generally, a high standard of student dress should be exhibited. Students may wear shorts to school but are expected to keep the shorts within acceptable limits. There should be no skin or underwear visible between the armpits and about the finger-tips when arms are down. Students wearing clothes that does not cover this area will be asked to change or have a change of clothes brought for them. We also expect shirts to be worn at all times in and around the school. Clothing and/or accessories that display reference to alcohol, drugs, or contain racist, profane, or sexist statements are not appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoes</p>
<p>Everyone MUST wear shoes at all times. If a student is not wearing shoes, he/she will be told to go to the office for a shoe ticket. The student must take one portion of the shoe ticket back to the staff member who told him/her to get it. Non-marking runners MUST be worn to participate in the gym. If a student does not have shoes to wear in the gym, he/she may sit on the bench or the stage to watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hats and Hoods</p>
<p>Each teacher will decide if hats and/or hoods may be worn in their classrooms. If they are not allowed in a specific space, a sign will be posted. Students are expected to remove hats and hoods for the singing of O Canada. Students may not leave class to get their hat.</p>
<p><strong>ALCOHOL/DRUGS/TOBACCO/E-CIGARETTE USE</strong></p>
<p>-AT SCHOOL, ON SCHOOL PROPERTY, AT EXTRA-CURRICULAR FUNCTIONS, AND ON SCHOOL EXCURSIONS</p>
<p>Any possession and/or&nbsp;use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco&nbsp;by ​students will have the following results:</p>
<ol>
<li>An immediate 2 day out-of-school suspension.</li>
<li>The loss of all potential recommendations for that school year.</li>
<li>While on excursions, being sent home at the student's expense (when applicable).</li>
<li>Other consequences involving school community service jobs as directed by the school administration. The parents/guardians would be required to provide supervision of the work to be done.</li>
<li>Referral to the proper authorities may also occur.</li>
</ol>
