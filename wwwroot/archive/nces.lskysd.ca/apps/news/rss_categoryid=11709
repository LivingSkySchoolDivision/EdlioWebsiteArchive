					<description><![CDATA[All Living Sky School Division schools will be closed on Monday, November 9th.  

Many factors were considered before making this decision. 

The severe weather conditions will result in bus cancellations and will make it difficult for staff who live out of town to get to school.  Usually, even in such a circumstance, schools remain open. However, the pandemic is a complicating factor. Because we must keep students/staff in cohorts, we will not have the ability to group students from multiple grades together with a staff member when their teachers are not able to be at school. By making the decision this evening, we hope that families have some time to make childcare arrangements as required.]]></description>
